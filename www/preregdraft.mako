                                      <p>Preregistration is the act of submitting a research study design, sampling protocol, and analysis plan before conducting a study. A researcher who pre-registers her plan commits to collect and analyze data exactly as described in the archived, time stamped plan. As it is currently practiced, the research workflow can often lead to irreproducible results. This is not caused by ill intentions or fraud, but simply because there are many possible tests and such strong incentives to find and publish results that offer the most compelling stories. Since any research question can be analyzed many different of ways, virtually every dataset will some significant relationships if investigated sufficiently.</p>

                                      <p>These problems are the inevitable result of misaligned incentives and subtle biases. Preregistration is a tool that helps us to be more open about our research practices. It allows us to clearly present the results of confirmatory analyses on hypotheses made a priori while still allowing us to present exploratory results as valuable findings that warrant further investigation.</p>

                                      <p>The process of preregistering one's plans is beneficial to both the scientific field and to the scientist. By writing out detailed data collection methods, analysis plans, and rules for excluding or missing data, we make important decisions that affect our workflow earlier, without the biases that occur once the data are in front of us.</p>
                                    <h3>The Preregistration Challenge</h3>
                                      <p>Old habits die hard. We have $1 million to give away in order to encourage this practice. We are awarding $1,000 each to 1,000 researchers who publish articles in an eligible journal that report on a study and its analysis preregistered through the OSF. Please review the information on this webpage to learn how you could be one of them! As with any competition, certain terms and conditions apply, but please ask us (prereg@cos.io) if you have questions!</p>

                                          As you prepare to submit your preregistration, you may use either this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jBLsU-xldVvMRZXHou2CHOxpa6yfax859K7s53dNgOs/edit" target="_blank">Google Doc</a> or Word template to prepare your research plan.</p>

                                            <b>Sample size</b><p>We sometimes stop data collection once a significant effect emerges. However, this increases the likelihood of committing a Type I error. Sample sizes that are predetermined before data collection, even if they are arbitrary or constrained by resources, avoid this bias.</p>

                                            <b>Exclusion criteria and missing data</b><p>Make these decisions before seeing how they affect your results. </p>

Once accepted, your research plan will be registered. It will appear as a preregistration on the OSF and your study will be eligible for the prize. Any preregistrations that do not go through this review process are not eligible for the Prize.</p>

                                        <li><b>Analyze according to your preregistered plan</b> <p>Your analysis must run precisely according to what you reported in your preregistration. Any additional analyses are acceptable for generating new hypotheses, but must be clearly differentiated from your registered results in the article.</p>

                                        <li><b>Write up your results</b> <p>Your article must adhere to these guidelines. For example, you must distinguish between confirmatory results that came from testing the hypotheses stated in your plan, and any exploratory analyses you conducted. There must also be a URL link to your registration on the OSF.</p>

                                        <li><b>Submit your manuscript for publication</b><p> Only peer-reviewed manuscripts published in an eligible journal can receive the prize.</p>

                                              Yes and no. You are obligated to conduct and report the exact tests that you specified. However, everyone knows that many novel discoveries are sometimes completely unanticipated. The goal of preregistration is not to stop researchers from conducting any 'exploratory' analyses, it simply makes clear which results were the outcome of planned analyses and which were not (see Chambers, et. al, 2014).
                                              </p><p>Exploring a dataset to look for unexpected relationships results in testable hypotheses, subjecting data to planned, confirmatory analyses is the best way to test those hypotheses. Making the distinction between exploratory and confirmatory analysis more transparent allows the reader to fairly evaluate the evidence being presented (see Wagenmakers et al., 2012).

                                                  <li><strong>Studies in which you are not testing the significance of a specific null hypothesis.</strong> Pre-registration can best reduce bias when the researcher intends to test collected data against a null hypothesis. There are many publishable, peer-reviewed endeavors in which this is not the case.
                                                  <li><strong>Hypothesis testing using pre-existing data.</strong> Using previously-collected data places additional burden on the researcher to demonstrate that no biases have influenced their decision making process. Seeing descriptive statistics prior to analysis inevitably affect analysis decisions. See above.
                                                  <li><strong>Field studies.</strong> Field science can be particularly challenging, with many variables outside of a researcher's control that affect the ability to collect data. Pilot trials, feedback from peers, and additional time or imagination in the planning phase can help to make your registered plans more accurate.

                                                       Registered Reports are a particular publication format in which both the preregistered plans and the final manuscript undergo peer review. In the first stage, reviewers and editors evaluate the relevance of the research questions and the proposed methods to answer them. Submissions that pass stage one review are offered ‘in principle acceptance’ (IPA), and the results are guaranteed to be published regardless of findings, as long as the methodology is carried out as described. Stage two peer review evaluates the complete manuscript before publication. In most cases, the Pre-Reg Challenge is not part of a Registered Report.

However, every decision included in the pre-registration process is one that a researcher will have to make at some point anyway, and making these decisions up front, before data collection begins, can improve your workflow and reduce subtle biases. Our goal is to create a system that is transparent and easy to use, and we welcome feedback (prereg@cos.io).

We also know that many publishable results are often not able to be reproduced. Therefore, we have created this incentive for researchers to try a new method. Our success will be measured by the number of award recipients who return to the process and register another analysis plan in the future (without being paid to do so!) because they have found it to improve their workflow and the reliability of their findings.

In other words, they have less than an 80% chance of observing an effect with the sample size they use, given the alternative hypothesis is true. You can learn more about power analysis and how to conduct one here. If your power analysis indicates that you require a sample size outside of your available resources, we recommend combining resources with collaborators in order to avoid underpowered studies. Researchers may also be interested in an sequential analysis, an alternative approach to achieving high power (Lakens, 2014).

There are both strong theoretical reasons to pre-register (Chambers et al., 2014; Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011), and some empirical evidence that supports its effectiveness <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132382" target="_blank">(Kaplan and Irvin, 2015)</a>. We hope that the Pre-Reg Challenge will encourage researchers to give pre-registration a try. During the prize period we will be conducting a parallel metascience project to evaluate the influence of pre-registration on researchers' behaviors and the reproducibility of their studies. We would be delighted if you would consider participating by providing feedback on the pre-registration process.

We suggest that you define a 'decision-tree' containing logical IF-THEN rules that specify the analyses that will be used in specific situations. We have put together some example decision trees to give you some ideas of how to accomplish this. In the event that you need to conduct an unplanned analysis, please note that preregistration does not prevent you from doing so, it simply makes clear which analyses were planned and which were not.

Preregistration allows you to more easily distinguish between hypothesis testing analyses (the "confirmatory" analyses) and hypothesis generating, exploratory analyses. Accordingly, articles must be reviewed to verify that the plans were followed and new analyses were appropriately separated.</p>
                                            Below are examples of deviations from the pre-registered plans and how a researcher could respond to them. </p>
                                            <ul>
                                            <li><p><strong>Deviations from Sampling Plan.</strong> </p>
                                            An author may not be able to recruit a sufficient number of participants to reach 95% power, but ended up with just over 80% power. In this case, the author should explain how their efforts were exhaustive and not influenced by the data collected up to that point.</p>
                                            <li><p><strong>Deviations from Design Plan</p></strong>
                                            Partway through data collection, a researcher notices that lichens with more sun exposure tend to show the phenotype that was expected only during a certain time of day. The researcher should either preregister a new plan with "sun exposure" as a predictor variable or include that new variable under "exploratory" results.</p>
                                            <li><p><strong>Deviations from Analysis Plan</p></strong>
                                            An author noticed that by controlling for one particular variable (e.g. the age of the subjects, the number of offspring a fish had, or the size of the local economy) the expected relationship became statistically significant. Since this was not predicted from the beginning (even if makes perfect sense in hindsight!) this would have to be clearly labeled as exploratory analysis. If the author wanted to keep it as confirmatory results, the analysis could be rerun with this control on another set of data, or part of the data that had been kept aside from the beginning, but that analysis would also have to be preregistered in order to be eligible for the prize.</p>
